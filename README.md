# DEEPScreen: Virtual Screening Using Convolutional Neural Networks By Images of Compounds
DEEPScreen is a large-scale DTI prediction system, for early stage drug discovery, using deep convolutional neural networks. One of the main advantages of DEEPScreen is employing readily available 2-D structural representations of compounds at the input level instead of conventional descriptors that display limited performance. DEEPScreen learns complex features inherently from the 2-D representations, thus producing highly accurate predictions. DEEPScreen system was trained for 704 target proteins (using curated bioactivity data) and finalized with rigorous hyper-parameter optimization tests.

## How to run DEEPScreen to train a model for a ChEMBL target
* Install dependencies and necessary libraries.
* Clone the DEEPScreen repository
* Decompress the zipped files
* Run DEEPScreen script by providing following command line arguments:
    * DNN architecture (ImageNetInceptionV2, CNNModel)
    * target ChEMBL ID
    * optimizer type (adam, momentum, rmsprop)
    * learning rate
    * number of epochs
    * number of neurons in the first fully-connected layer
    * number of neurons in the second fully-connected layer
    * drop-out keep rate
    * save model (should be 1 to save the model or 0 (not save))


To train a model using the same hyper-parameters as DEEPScreen, you can use the hyper-parameters available in **deepscreen_models_hyperparameters_performance_results.tsv** which is located under **resultFiles** folder. Below is a sample command to train a model for target **CHEMBL1790**.
```
python trainDEEPScreen.py CNNModel CHEMBL1790 adam 0.0005 15 128 0 0.8 1
```
## Output of the script
The evaluation results and predictions of independent test compounds are given as the output of this script. In the last line, the predictions for the test compounds are written in a tab-separated format where each field is separated by comma in the following format:
* <compound_id>,<prediction_outcome>,<true_label
The ouput of the above command is written below as an example:
```
Test AUC:0.9445025083612041
Test AUPRC:0.9379908635681835
Test_f1score:0.88

The output of these commads same as the output shown above. Please note that you should unzip the corresponding folders (**DUDEDatasetFiles.zip**, **MUVDatasetFiles.zip** or **Lenselink_Dataset_Files.zip**) before running training scripts.

## How to use pre-trained models to generate predictions for a set of compounds.
The model files should be located under **tflearnModels** folder. The model files for target **CHEMBL1790** are put under **tflearnModels** folder as an example. Each target has a model which consists of three files. For our example, the the model files for or target **CHEMBL1790** are as follows:
* CNNModel_CHEMBL1790_adam_0.0005_15_128_0.8_True-300.data-00000-of-00001
* CNNModel_CHEMBL1790_adam_0.0005_15_128_0.8_True-300.index
* CNNModel_CHEMBL1790_adam_0.0005_15_128_0.8_True-300.meta

Users should run **loadDEEPScreenModel.py** script to provide predictions for a set of compounds. The arguments of this script are as follows:
```
python loadDEEPScreenModel.py  <target_name> <model_name> <path_to_smiles_of_compounds>
```
where **<target_name>** is the name of the ChEMBL target, **<model_name>** stands for the name of the model for the corresponding target stored under the **tflearnModels** folder and the last argument is the path to the SMILES of compounds. The SMILES file is a tab-seperated file with a header where the first column is compound identifier and the second colunmn is the smiles strings. You could have additional columns which are discarded by the script.There is a sample file (i.e. **sample_test_compound_file.txt**) under **../trainingFiles** folder. You can run the following script to get the predictions for the compounds in the sample file. 
```
python loadDEEPScreenModel.py  CHEMBL1790 CNNModel_CHEMBL1790_adam_0.0005_15_128_0.8_True-300 ../trainingFiles/sample_test_compound_file.txt
```
The script provides the compund identifiers which are predicted as active as output. 
```
ACTIVE PREDICTIONS:CHEMBL1790
CHEMBL350383
CHEMBL319636
CHEMBL182627
CHEMBL444956
CHEMBL331956
```
